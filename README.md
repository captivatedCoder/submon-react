Simple React front end for managing subscription expirations.  Has 3 pages, only the login screen is accessible if no auth token exists.  It can be filtered by subtype as well as searched by name.  It is a reactive design, scaling to work on mobile devices.  When scaled down, the filter function is removed but the search remains.
